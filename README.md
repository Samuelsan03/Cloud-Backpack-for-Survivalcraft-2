# Cloud-Backpack-for-Survivalcraft-2
Cloud Backpack is a mod for Survivalcraft 2 that acts as a cloud-based storage system for your items, freeing you from the limitations of a full inventory. Best of all, your items are preserved even after death—no need to return to the spot where you were killed to recover them. Even better, it includes a built-in crafting system panel, so you don’t have to search for wood to craft one when starting a new world in Survival, Harmless, Challenging, or Cruel mode.
